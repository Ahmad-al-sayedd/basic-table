## About The Project

This project showcases a custom-designed table built entirely with HTML and CSS. The goal of this project was to create a visually appealing, responsive, and accessible table that can be used to display structured data effectively in a web application.

The table includes various styling techniques to improve readability, layout, and user interaction. CSS has been used to apply color schemes, borders, and hover effects, enhancing the visual experience for users. The project demonstrates a strong focus on clean design principles and ease of customization, making it suitable for a range of use cases, from basic data display to complex information tables.
